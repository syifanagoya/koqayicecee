He was born on the 28th day of July 1992. He is a native of Edo State, Nigeria, but grew up in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. He is of Isan ethnicity. He has a large family that includes his two siblings as well as a large extended family. He is, however, the only son of his parents.</span></p><p>Twyse’s mother is from Ondo state and he lived a few parts of his early years in Germany&nbsp;before relocating to&nbsp;Port Harcourt, Nigeria. After his dad’s demise, he moved to&nbsp;Ibadan where he lived with his grandmother. There, he became fluent in the Yoruba language.</p><p><span>Twyse attended St. Isabel Nursery & Primary School, Obiye Primary School, Port Harcourt, and Federal Government College, Odogbolu, Ogun State. He then gained admission to the Indian school Annamalai University, &nbsp;India, where he studied graphic design and animation. He also studied Information and Communications Technology at London Metropolitan University.</span></p><p><span>Twyse was born into a family of entertainers. His mother is a renowned gospel musician, and his father is a professional comedian. This family background has had an immense impact on his comedy career and style. Twyse was exposed to comedy and music when he was young, which led him to want to work in the entertainment business.</span></p><h2><strong>How Twyse Ereme Became a Comedian</strong></h2><p>Even as a son of two entertainers, Twyse never saw himself following the path of his parents. Instead, he dreamt of becoming a filmmaker and while he was schooling, he made skits just to kill boredom. He had even once attempted suicide out of depression&nbsp; -thanks to a few friends who came to his rescue.</p><p><span>Twyse rose to fame in the early 2010s as a member of the Nigerian comedy duo, Emeyal Comedy. Their funny and relatable skits on YouTube attracted a lot of attention and made them very popular.</span> He then launched his own YouTube channel, Twyse Comedy, which became a platform where he could showcase his comedic skits. The first project he posted on the channel was a video captioned “Lyrically Blessed”.&nbsp; He also used this platform to showcase his creative and inventive style of comedy.</p><p><span>Today, Twyse has successfully established himself as one of Nigeria’s top comedians. In 2019, he was listed as one of the most influential Nigerian comedians. He also has his own production company called Twyse Ereme Productions, where he makes movies, TV shows, and other kinds of entertainment.</span></p><h2><strong>His Success Journey</strong></h2><p><span>Twyse Ereme has built a reputation as an entertainer and is one of the most in-demand online comic artists in the country. He is known for his popular YouTube videos, which include </span><i><span>Twyse and Family –&nbsp; </span></i><span>a family comedy which is filled with characters</span><span> like Daddy and Mommy Tobi, Grandma, Tobi and Sade and all the members of the Twyse family. The series is a reflection of a typical Nigerian home with him playing all the roles but different characters.</span></p><p><span>Twyse’s skill has seen him produce over a hundred skits. He was in a TV show that won an award and was nominated for “Best Comedy Act” at the 2018 Nigerian Entertainment Awards.</span></p><h2><strong>Twyse is Also a Singer</strong></h2><p>Though not considering singing as a major profession, Twyse has also made a name for himself as a singer. Aside from comedy, he sings and records his songs in his own leisure time. His first EP was released on 26th November 2018. It was a six-track album titled “The Trash EP”. In 2019, he released the music video for his song “Give Me a Sign” which garnered over 140k views on his YouTube channel.</p><p>In July 2019, he also released an official music video for his song ‘Trippin’, featuring Trod. In September 2021, &nbsp;Twyse Ereme released a new parody tagged “Evergreen Nigerian Gospel Songs”. The parody, apparently, contains gospel songs released years back but they still have listeners more than any other song. Aside from making his own songs, Ereme has also featured in some songs produced by most of Nigeria’s up-and-coming artists.</p><h3><strong>Below Are Some of Twyse Ereme’s Songs</strong></h3><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe>Trippin feat.
